## About

**Cosmology and String Theory**

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [DESY Theory Group](https://theory-hamburg.desy.de/). Most of my work to date has been on inflation, a theory of the very early universe where the quantum fluctuations of one or more scalar fields gives rise to density perturbations which seed the formation of all structure we observe today (galaxies, stars, people etc.). In my view, the most exciting consequence of this is that we can use the statistics of the distribution of matter in the universe to learn about particle physics at extremely high energies. Possibly much higher than we will ever be able to probe with terrestrial experiments. Indeed, cosmology may be one of our best hopes for testing string theory. As such, I try to sit between the string theory and cosmology communities, developing methods for computing predictions from string theory embeddings of inflation.

**Biology**

More recently I have become extremely interested in more theoretical aspects of systems biology.
