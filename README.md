## My Research

### Biology
I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Debbie Marks Lab](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/), in the Systems Biology department of Harvard Medical School. My work centers on developing probabilistic models of biological sequence. This can be amino acid sequences, if building a model of a particular protein, or whole genomes.

### Cosmology and String Theory
Prior to my research in biology most of my work was on inflation. This is a theory of the very early universe involving a period of accelerated expansion, where the quantum fluctuations of one or more scalar fields gives rise to an initial distribution of gravitational wells. Matter sinking into these wells is thought to be the seeding process for the formation of all structure we observe today (galaxies, stars, people etc.). In my view, the most exciting consequence of this is that we can use the statistics of the distribution of matter in the universe to learn about particle physics at extremely high energies. Possibly much higher than we will ever be able to probe with terrestrial experiments. Indeed, cosmology may be one of our best hopes for testing string theory. As such, I enjoyed sitting between the string theory and cosmology communities, developing methods for computing predictions from string theory embeddings of inflation.

## Software

**The Transport Method:**
The transport method is a technique for computing the two-point and three-point correlation functions of fluctuations generated in an inflationary epoch during the early universe. Our site [transportmethod.com](https://transportmethod.com/) collects a number of tools written in Mathematica, C++ and Python.

**MULTIMODECODE:**
MultiModeCode is a Fortran 95/2000 package for the numerical exploration of multifield inflation models, available from [modecode.org](http://modecode.org/).

## Talks

I am trying to get into the habit of posting my slides from previous presentations on GitHub's Speaker Deck. My "Decks" can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jonnygfrazer).
